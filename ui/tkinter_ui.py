# Simple desktop GUI using Tkinter (Python’s built-in GUI library).
# - Provides text fields for user input (expression, x0, tolerance, max iterations).
# - A "Run SFPI" button triggers the solver.
# - Displays the root, iteration count, and a scrollable iteration table.
# Connects to: solver modules (parser, iteration, convergence, table).
# Kept lightweight — just a calculator-style window, no complex menus.
