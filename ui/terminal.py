# Interactive command-line interface.
# - Asks the user step-by-step for input (expression, x0, tolerance, max iterations).
# - Calls solver functions to run the iteration.
# - Prints results and the iteration table directly in the terminal.
# Connects to: parser.py (to compile expressions), iteration.py (to run solver), table.py (to format output).
